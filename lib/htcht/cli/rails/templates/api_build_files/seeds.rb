# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Enviroment Specific Seed data is handled with the seedbank gem and follows this structure
#
# db/seeds/
#   bar.seeds.rb
#   development/
#     users.seeds.rb
#   foo.seeds.rb
#
# This would generate the following Rake tasks
#
# rake db:seed                    Load the seed data from db/seeds.rb, db/seeds/*.seeds.rb and db/seeds/ENVIRONMENT/*.seeds.rb. ENVIRONMENT is the current environment in Rails.env.
# rake db:seed:bar                Load the seed data from db/seeds/bar.seeds.rb
# rake db:seed:common             Load the seed data from db/seeds.rb and db/seeds/*.seeds.rb.
# rake db:seed:development        Load the seed data from db/seeds.rb, db/seeds/*.seeds.rb and db/seeds/development/*.seeds.rb.
# rake db:seed:development:users  Load the seed data from db/seeds/development/users.seeds.rb
# rake db:seed:original           Load the seed data from db/seeds.rb
